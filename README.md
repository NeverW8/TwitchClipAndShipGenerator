# Twitch Clip Generator
Twitch Clip Generator download 20 clips from the top 7 categories on twitch, edits them together and eventually will publish each category according to each category/day.

The script is made from a debian based system and is expected to run from it.
But it shouldn't be a hassle to run it on other systems.

# File requirements
You'll need a linux/bash terminal (WSL will work aswell).

These files/packages is more or less needed for it to work.
